We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 3.9.5 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 3.9.4, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

The [3.9.5 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.9.5-Release-Notes) can be found on the wiki, as well as the
list of [deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.9.5-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/).

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/index.html) and our [HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap). The
legacy Homebrew _vert.x_ formula will provide the latest Vert.x 4 release and therefore you should drop this formula and use the new _vertx3_ formula
from the new TAP.

The event bus client using the SockJS bridge is available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.vertx%22%20AND%20v%3A%223.9.5%22) and you can get the distribution on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.9.5/view).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
