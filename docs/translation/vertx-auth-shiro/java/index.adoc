= Shiro Auth provider (deprecated module)

WARNING: that Shiro as been deprecated in favor of vertx-auth-properties as well as vertx-auth-ldap

This is an auth provider implementation that uses http://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro].  To use this
project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
 <artifactId>vertx-auth-shiro</artifactId>
 <version>4.0.3</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-auth-shiro:4.0.3'
----

We provide out of the box support for properties and LDAP based auth using Shiro, and you can also plugin in any
other Shiro Realm which expects username and password for credentials.

To create an instance of the provider you use `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/ext/auth/shiro/ShiroAuth.html[ShiroAuth]`. You specify the type of
Shiro auth provider that you want with `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/ext/auth/shiro/ShiroAuthRealmType.html[ShiroAuthRealmType]`, and you specify the
configuration in a JSON object.

Here's an example of creating a Shiro auth provider by specifying the type:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject config = new JsonObject().put("properties_path", "classpath:test-auth.properties");

AuthProvider provider = ShiroAuth.create(vertx, new ShiroAuthOptions().setType(ShiroAuthRealmType.PROPERTIES).setConfig(config));
----

== Authentication

When authenticating using this implementation, it assumes `username` and `password` fields are present in the
authentication info:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject authInfo = new JsonObject().put("username", "tim").put("password", "sausages");

authProvider.authenticate(authInfo, res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    User user = res.result();
  } else {
    // Failed!
  }
});
----

== Authorisation - Permission-Role Model

Although Vert.x auth itself does not mandate any specific model of permissions (they are just opaque strings), this
implementation uses a familiar user/role/permission model, where a user can have zero or more roles and a role
can have zero or more permissions.

If validating if a user has a particular permission simply pass the permission into.
`link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/ext/auth/User.html#isAuthorized-java.lang.String-io.vertx.core.Handler-[isAuthorized]` as follows:

[source,java]
----
user.isAuthorized("newsletter:edit:13", res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    boolean hasPermission = res.result();
  } else {
    // Failed to
  }
});
----
If validating that a user has a particular _role_ then you should prefix the argument with the role prefix.

[source,java]
----
user.isAuthorized("role:manager", res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    boolean hasRole = res.result();
  } else {
    // Failed to
  }
});
----

=== The Shiro properties auth provider

This auth provider implementation uses Apache Shiro to get user/role/permission information from a properties file.

The implementation will, by default, look for a file called `vertx-users.properties` on the classpath.

If you want to change this, you can use the `properties_path` configuration element to define how the properties
file is found.

The default value is `classpath:vertx-users.properties`.

If the value is prefixed with `classpath:` then the classpath will be searched for a properties file of that name.

If the value is prefixed with `file:` then it specifies a file on the file system.

If the value is prefixed with `url:` then it specifies a URL from where to load the properties.

The properties file should have the following structure:

Each line should either contain the username, password and roles for a user or the permissions in a role.

For a user line it should be of the form:

user.{username}={password},{roleName1},{roleName2},...,{roleNameN}

For a role line it should be of the form:

role.{roleName}={permissionName1},{permissionName2},...,{permissionNameN}

Here's an example:
----
user.tim = mypassword,administrator,developer
user.bob = hispassword,developer
user.joe = anotherpassword,manager
role.administrator=*
role.manager=play_golf,say_buzzwords
role.developer=do_actual_work
----

When describing roles a wildcard `*` can be used to indicate that the role has all permissions.

=== The Shiro LDAP auth provider

The LDAP auth realm gets user/role/permission information from an LDAP server.

The following configuration properties are used to configure the LDAP realm:

`ldap_user_dn_template`:: this is used to determine the actual lookup to use when looking up a user with a particular
id. An example is `uid={0},ou=users,dc=foo,dc=com` - the element `{0}` is substituted with the user id to create the
actual lookup. This setting is mandatory.
`ldap_url`:: the url to the LDAP server. The url must start with `ldap://` and a port must be specified.
An example is `ldap://myldapserver.mycompany.com:10389`
`ldap_authentication_mechanism`:: Sets the type of LDAP authentication mechanism to use when connecting to the LDAP server.
`ldap_context_factory_class_name`:: The name of the ContextFactory class to use. This defaults to the SUN LDAP JNDI implementation
but can be overridden to use custom LDAP factories.
`ldap_pooling_enabled`:: Sets whether or not connection pooling should be used when possible and appropriate.
`ldap_referral`:: Sets the LDAP referral behavior when creating a connection.  Defaults to `follow`.  See the Sun/Oracle LDAP
referral documentation for more: http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/referral/jndi.html
`ldap_system_username`:: Sets the system username that will be used when creating an LDAP connection used for authorization
queries. The user must have the ability to query for authorization data for any application user.
Note that setting this property is not required if the calling LDAP Realm does not perform authorization checks.
`ldap_system_password`:: Sets the password of the  that will be used when
creating an LDAP connection used for authorization queries.
Note that setting this property is not required if the calling LDAP Realm does not perform authorization checks.

For more information, refer to the documentation of org.apache.shiro.realm.ldap.JndiLdapContextFactory.

=== Using another Shiro Realm

It's also possible to create an auth provider instance using a pre-created Apache Shiro Realm object.

This is done as follows:

[source,java]
----
AuthProvider provider = ShiroAuth.create(vertx, realm);
----

The implementation currently assumes that user/password based authentication is used.
