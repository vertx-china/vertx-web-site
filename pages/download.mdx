# Distributions

On this page, you can download the Vert.x distributions. The distributions provide the `vertx` command line tool. To modify the content of the distribution once
downloaded, use the stack manager.

If you are using Apache Maven or Gradle, you don't need to download anything. The required artifacts
are retrieved by your dependency manager.

## Downloads

You can browse available 4.x packages from [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/).

You can browse available 3.x packages from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.9.4/view).

## From Homebrew

The full distribution can be downloaded from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

### Vert.x 4

```text
$ brew tap vertx-distrib/tap
$ brew install vertx4
```

### Vert.x 3

```text
$ brew tap vertx-distrib/tap
$ brew install vertx3
```

### Legacy vert.x formula

The _vert.x_ formula still exists and has been forcefully upgraded to Vert.x 4 forcing users to upgrade their installation to Vert.x 4.

This formula is still maintained by the Homebrew community.

## From SDKMan

```text
$ sdk install vertx
```

Vert.x 4 is available.

The latest Vert.x 3.9.x version remains the default version.

## From Docker

You can install the full vert.x distribution in a Docker container:

### Vert.x 4

```text
docker run -i -t vertx/vertx4-exec
```

### Vert.x 3

```text
docker run -i -t vertx/vertx3-exec
```

## Snapshots

We have continuous integration builds for all the Vert.x components. We also publish shapshots to
the Sonatype OSS Snapshot [repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/vertx/).
