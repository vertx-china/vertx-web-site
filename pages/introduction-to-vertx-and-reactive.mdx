# Eclipse Vert.x and reactive in just a few words

Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building **reactive** applications on the JVM.
Reactive applications are both **scalable** as workloads grow, and **resilient** when failures arise.
A reactive application is **responsive** as it keeps latency under control by making efficient usage of system resources, and by protecting itself from errors.

Vert.x is backed by a large ecosystem of reactive modules with just anything you need when writing modern services: a comprehensive web stack, reactive database drivers, messaging, event streams, clustering, metrics, distributed tracing and more.

Vert.x is a tool-kit and not a framework that ships with black magic: **what you write is actually what you get to execute**, as simple as that.

So what makes Vert.x a great option for writing your next **cloud-native** or **[twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/)** app?

## In the beginning, there were threads...

The classic approach to concurrency is to use **threads**.
Multiple threads can live within a single **process**, perform **concurrent** work, and **share** the same memory space.

Most application and service development frameworks are based on multi-threading.
On the surface, the model of having **1 thread per connection** is reassuring because developers can rely on traditional **imperative style** code.

This is fine, especially if you forget about those silly mistakes you can make with multi-threading and memory access ...

## Multi-threading is "simple" but limited

What happens as the workload grows beyond moderate workloads?
[(see the C10k problem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem)

The answer is simple: you start making your operating system kernel **suffer** because there is too much **context switching** work with in-flight requests.

Some of your threads will be **blocked** because they are waiting on I/O operations to complete, some will be **ready** to handle I/O results, and some will be in the middle of doing CPU-intensive tasks.

Modern kernels have very good schedulers, but you cannot expect them to deal with 50&thinsp;000 threads as easily as they would do with 5&thinsp;000. Also, threads aren't cheap: creating a thread takes a few milliseconds, and a new thread eats about 1MB of memory.

## Asynchronous programming: scalability and resource efficiency

Processing more concurrent connections with less threads is possible when you use **asynchronous I/O**.
Instead of blocking a thread when an I/O operation occurs, we move on to another task which is ready to progress, and resume the initial task later when it is ready.

Vert.x multiplexes concurrent workloads using **event loops**.

Code that runs on event loops should not perform blocking I/O or lengthy processing. But don't worry if you have such code: Vert.x has worker threads and APIs to process events back on an event loop.

## Pick the best asynchronous programming model for your problem domain

We know that asynchronous programming requires more efforts.
At the core of Vert.x, we support **callbacks** and **promises/futures**, the latter being a simple and elegant model for chaining asynchronous operations.

Advanced reactive programming is possible with [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), and if you prefer something closer to traditional imperative programming, then we are happy to provide you with first-class support of [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).

Vert.x supports many asynchronous programming models: choose what works best for each problem you need to solve!

## Don't let failures ruin responsiveness

Failures happen all the time.
A database will go down, the network will go down, or some service you depend on will become unresponsive.

Vert.x offers tools to keep latency under control, including a simple and efficient **circuit breaker**.

## A rich ecosystem

The _Eclipse Vert.x stack_ contains modules for building modern, end-to-end reactive services.
From efficient reactive database clients to event streaming, messaging and web stacks, the Eclipse Vert.x project has you covered:
